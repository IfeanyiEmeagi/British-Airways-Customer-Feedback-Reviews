# Forage Work Simulation Project - British Airways Customer Feedback Reviews

The Forage work simulation project provides real world tasks to both experienced and fresh graduates to tried their hands on. In this task, I scrapped British Airways customer reviews hosted on Skytrax[https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/page/1/?sortby=post_date%3ADesc&pagesize=10] and apply topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the most prevalent issues the customers are saying.
